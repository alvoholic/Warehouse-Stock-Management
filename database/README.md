-- README.md
-- Warehouse Stock Management - Database Design
-- Deliverables included in this single file for convenience:
-- 1) README (this header)
-- 2) ERD placeholder: erd_diagram.png (create using draw.io or dbdiagram.io and add to /database/)
-- 3) schema.sql (below)
--
-- Design choices (short):
-- - Postgres dialect used (BIGSERIAL primary keys, FK constraints, COMMENTs). Replace types if using other RDBMS.
-- - Normalized schema: master tables (products, categories, suppliers, warehouses), transactional tables (purchase_orders, sales_orders, stock_movements), and a current stock materialized table (stock).
-- - stock holds current level per product per warehouse and includes reorder_point / safety_stock.
-- - All changes produce audit entries in audit_log. An example trigger/function is provided to capture inserts/updates/deletes for selected tables.
-- - stock_movements tracks every movement with explicit movement_type (IN/OUT/TRANSFER/ADJUSTMENT). For transfers both from_warehouse_id and to_warehouse_id are used.
-- - Unique and check constraints ensure data quality. Indexes added for common lookup columns.
--
-- File structure suggested when committing to repo:
-- /database/
--   - erd_diagram.png      <-- create from your ERD tool and add
--   - schema.sql           <-- this file
--   - README.md            <-- you may extract the README header into README.md
